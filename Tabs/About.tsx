              JobBridge is a mobile-first platform created for the Philippines. 
              It connects everyday job seekers, especially those blocked by 
              high qualification requirements, with real opportunities from 
              small businesses, local employers, and larger companies. Whether 
              you're in Quezon City or anywhere in the country, we help turn 
              the daily struggle for stable work into real possibilities.

            <p>
              In a country where strict requirements and skills mismatches leave 
              many talented Filipinos unemployed or underemployed, we exist to 
              lower those barriers. JobBridge provides fast, simple access to 
              entry-level, semi-skilled, and fair-wage jobs, even when salaries 
              match or fall below standard rates based on the role. By empowering 
              recruiters to post quickly and applicants to apply easily, we help 
              reduce poverty, stabilize family incomes, improve mental well-being, 
              and build brighter futures for individuals and communities across 
              the Philippines.
